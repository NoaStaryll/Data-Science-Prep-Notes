## About Python
* **Python**: General purpose coding language, can be used in different venues. Web apps and software. 
  * An interpreted language that requires an interpreter.
* **Compiled Language**: Require that your code be translated into a more fundamental machine language before you run it.( C/C++, Java/Scala
  * Write/ Edit Code
	* Compile Code
	* Run the compiled code
* **Documentation**: https://docs.python.org/3/
* **Style Guide**: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* **Pseudocode**: Describes general algorithm for what you are trying to accomplish. 
  * Write code and translate into python



```python
# Assign the name 'z' to the integer value '10'
z = 10

# Increment 'z' by '1'
z += 1 # Equivalent to 'z = z + 1'
print(z)


# Assign the name 'a' to the integer value '3'
a = 3

# Multiply 'a' by 3, and assign the result to 'a'
a *= 3 # Equivalent to 'a = a * 3'
print(a)


# Incrementation works for other operators, too
b = 21
b /= 3 # Equivalent to 'b = b / 3'

# But remember that division results in a 'float'
print(type(b))
```
